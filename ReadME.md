#Recipe API

This is a RESTful API that contains data of all the meals in the MealDB database.
It was created as a full API from scratch. Frameworks were utilized from Mongoose, Axios, Express, and MongoDB to import data; Heroku was used for deployment. It contains 1000 recipes that users can search through.

#Strategy
-easily connected mealDB bc of prior use

-matched up paths with final design plan
-final styling for README and deployment to heroku
